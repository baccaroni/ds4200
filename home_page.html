        <p class="description" id="work-paragraph-1">
            My name is Bach, and I am currently a third-year majoring in Computer Science and Finance. 
            Aside from spending the majority of my time at school working, something that I enjoy doing a lot is photography. 
            Photography helps me reset my calm after working long hours with numbers and codes.
        </p>
        <p class="description" id="work-paragraph-2">
            My preferred type of work is storytelling. My photos usually serve as a means to convey a story, 
            typically about relationships. I love working with different tools, from DSLRs to travel cameras or even my phone. 
            My current set of tools includes a Canon 80D with a 50mm f1.8, a Sony Alpha a6400 paired with a 35-150mm lens, and a Fujifilm z5 travel camera. 
        </p>
        <p class="description" id="work-paragraph-3">
            My favorite settings for a shot really vary, from a darker outdoor place such as a bar counter, to a good day of sunlight outdoors, somewhere like a park. 
            For me, the ability to let my creative side go free and shoot quality pictures is fulfilling. After a good day of shooting, I will export my work and take a good look at them, 
            seeing what type of story I would like to write. These could be from my own experiences, a story that I heard, or just a figment of my imagination.
        </p>
        <p class="description" id="work-paragraph-4">
            All of my stories are published in the Instagram page above. Have a tour around there if you are feeling romantic!
