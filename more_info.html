    <!-- Main Content Section -->
    <p>
        Every relationship has a story behind it. I was a bartender, and over-the-bar-counter love stories were more than frequent. 
        Sometimes, it is a story of "how I met her," which is hopeful, beautiful, and full of affection. 
        But there are also stories of "how we part ways." 
    </p>
    <p>
        Inspiration for my work comes from those encounters, or sometimes from a good movie, a song, or my personal experiences. 
        There are so many love stories worth telling, and my goal is to convey these stories through my photos. 
        I aim to bring them to life because I believe many others out there share similar experiences and can sympathize.

        I experiment with different shot angles, subjects, and lighting to create my vision. Most of the time, my shots are intentional; 
        I imagine how the vision should look beforehand. The lighting must come from a certain angle, the subject positioned perfectly, 
        and their expression captured just right. Everything has to align to tell the story I want.
